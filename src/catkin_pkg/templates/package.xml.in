  <!-- Packages can have seven types of dependencies -->
  <!-- Dependencies can be catkin packages or system dependencies -->

<!-- Build: -->

  <!-- <buildtool_depend> -->
  <!-- Specify build system tools which this package needs to build itself.
       Typically the only build tool needed is catkin.
	   In a cross-compilation scenario build tool dependencies are for the 
	   architecture on which the compilation is performed. -->
  <!-- <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend> -->
@buildtool_depends

  <!-- <depend> -->
  <!-- Specifies that a dependency is a build, export, and execution dependency.
       Use <depend> whenever you have both <build_depend> and <run_depend> dependencies,
       or if you really do not care about the dependencies of your generated
       package binary. -->
  <!-- <depend>roscpp</depend> -->
@depends

  <!-- <build_depend> -->
  <!-- Specify which packages are needed to build this package.
    This is the case when any file from these packages is required at build time.
    This can be including headers from these packages at compilation time,
    linking against libraries from these packages or requiring any other resource
    at build time (especially when these packages are find_package()-ed in CMake). 
    In a cross-compilation scenario build dependencies are for the targeted architecture. -->
  <!-- <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend> -->
@build_depends

  <!-- <build_export_depend> -->
  <!-- Specify which packages are needed to build libraries against this package.
       This is the case when you transitively include their headers in public headers
       in this package (especially when these packages are declared as
       (CATKIN_)DEPENDS in catkin_package() in CMake) -->
  <!-- <build_export_depend>??</build_export_depend> -->
@build_export_depends

  <!-- <buildtool_export_depend> -->
  <!-- Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name that this package exports
       which must be compiled and run on the build system, not the target system.
       For cross-compilation, one must distinguish these from target build dependencies,
       which may be linked with your package and must be compiled for the target architecture. -->
  <!-- <buildtool_export_depend>??</buildtool_export_depend> -->
@buildtool_export_depends

<!-- Execution: -->

  <!-- <exec_depend> -->
  <!-- Specify which packages are needed to run code in this package.
       This is the case when you depend on shared libraries in this package
       (especially when these packages are declared as
       (CATKIN_)DEPENDS in catkin_package() in CMake) -->
  <!-- <exec_depend>rospy</exec_depend> -->
@exec_depends

<!-- Test: -->

  <!-- <test_depend> -->
  <!-- Specify only additional dependencies for unit tests.
       They should never duplicate any dependencies already
       mentioned as build or run dependencies -->
  <!-- <test_depend>python-mock</test_depend> -->
  <!-- <test_depend>gtest</test_depend> -->

<!-- Doc: -->

  <!-- <doc_depend> -->
  <!-- Specify documentation tools which this package needs to generate documentation -->
  <!-- <doc_depend>doxygen</doc_depend> -->

<!-- Replace: -->

  <!-- <replace> -->
  <!-- Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name that your package replaces.
       This has no effect on source builds, but maps to Replaces
       when creating Debian packages and Obsoletes for RPM packages  -->
  <!-- <replace>package_to_replace</replace> -->
@replaces

<!-- Conflict: -->
  
  <!-- <conflict> -->
  <!-- Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name with which your package conflicts.
       This package and the conflicting package should not be installed at the same time.
       This has no effect on source builds, but maps to Conflicts when creating Debian or RPM packages. -->

    <!-- <build_type> -->
    <!-- Various tools use this tag to determine how to handle a package.
         When the build type is cmake, the package is handled as a non-catkin CMake project.
         It cannot be included in a normal catkin workspace, but can instead use catkin_make_isolated.
         If no <build_type> is provided, catkin is assumed. -->

    <!-- <build_type>cmake</build_type> -->
@build_type

    <!-- <architecture_independent/> -->
    <!-- This empty tag indicates that your package produces no architecture-specific files once built.
         That information is intended for allowing optimization of packaging.
         It is recommended for metapackages and for packages defining only ROS messages and services.
         Python-only packages are reasonable candidates, too.
         It is not appropriate for any package which compiles C or C++ code. -->

    <!-- <deprecated>
           This package will be removed in ROS Hydro. Instead, use package
           FOO, which provides similar features with a different API.
