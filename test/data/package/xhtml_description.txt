A package with an XHTML description.

This package contains several xhtml tags which are, according to REP-149, meant to be properly handled but "XML tags and multiple whitespaces" may be stripped in some situations. Another sentence in this quasi-paragraph will continue to appear on the same plaintext line because there was no <br/> tag to indicate a newline should appear in the output text.
This text should appear on a subsequent line.
