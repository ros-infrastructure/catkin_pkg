## Declare ROS messages and services here

# add_message_files(
#   DIRECTORY msg
#   FILES
#     MyMessage1.msg
#     MyMessage2.msg
# )

# add_service_files(
#   DIRECTORY srv
#   FILES
#     MyService1.srv
#     MyService2.srv
# )

## Uncomment this if you have declared any messages or services
## and specify dependencies if any
# generate_messages(
#   DEPENDENCIES
#   std_msgs)


## System dependencies, Boost as an example, can be found like this
## usage examples below
# find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system)

## Use this to declare libraries that this package creates
# add_library(${PROJECT_NAME}
#   src/${PROJECT_NAME}/main.cpp
#   )

## Use this to declare executables that this package creates
# add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}_node src/main.cpp)

## Use this to e.g. make your executables depend on your libraries
# add_dependencies(${PROJECT_NAME}_node ${PROJECT_NAME})

## Specify additional locations of header files
# include_directories(include)

## specify what c++ libraries your c++ executable should be linked against
# target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_node
#   ${Boost_LIBRARIES}
#   )

## Use this to declare executable scripts (Python etc.)
# install(PROGRAMS
#   scripts/my_python_script
#   DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PROJECT_BIN_DESTINATION})

## Use this to declare c++ executables and/or libraries
# install(TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME}_node
#   ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PROJECT_LIB_DESTINATION}
#   LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PROJECT_LIB_DESTINATION})

## If specific folders are to be installed (no executable or library), use this
# install(DIRECTORY include/
#   DESTINATION ${CATKIN_GLOBAL_INCLUDE_DESTINATION}
#   FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h"
#   PATTERN ".svn" EXCLUDE)

## This is for any other files that should go into an install
# install(FILES
#   myfile1
#   myfile2
#   DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PROJECT_INCLUDE_DESTINATION}
# )

## Use this for c++ gtest unit tests
# catkin_add_gtest(${PROJECT_NAME}-test test/mytest)
# if(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME}-test)
#   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}-test_version)
# endif()

## Use this to declare python unit test folders
# catkin_add_nosetests(test)
